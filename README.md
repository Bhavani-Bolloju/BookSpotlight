# BookSpotLight

## Why this app?

A lot of book lovers struggle to find books by genre or track what they want to read. BookSpotlight solves this with real-time search, genre wise browsing, and bookmarking.

## Tech Stack
ReactJs, TypeScript, Firebase(Auth + Storage), SASS(CSS preprocessor), React Router, React Bootstrap, SWR, Google Books API.

## Features

- **Auth & Session**: Firebase login with auto-logout on session timeout.
- **Book Feed**: Genre-based book listing with infinite scroll.
- **Dynamic Search**: Search for any book via API, responsive results.
- **Book Details**: Separate page for each book with full description.
- **Bookmarking**: For saving favorite books
- Mobile Responsive + Fast loading with lazy load

## My Role

- Implemented secure auth system with Firebase, handled edge cases like session expiry
- Designed and coded the full UI in TypeScript.
- Integrated external REST APIs(Google books API) for live book search.
- Created a smooth infinite scroll experience using intersection observer.
- Worked on clean code structure, reusable components, and state management


## Future plans

- Implement a review and rating system for each book
- Add reading progress tracking and goal-setting features (e.g. pages/day or books/month)
- Enable dynamic book filtering and display based on selected genres or preferences
